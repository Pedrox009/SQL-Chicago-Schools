# SQL-Chicago-Schools

The city of Chicago released a dataset showing all school level performance data used to create School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year, a dataset showcasing crime statistics, and a dataset showcasing census statistics. We use SQL (SQLite) in a Jupyter environment to extract and analize this data and answer basic questions with SQL commands. THis data was given by IBM. A summary of the dataset values are described in the City of Chicago website linked within the Jupyter Notebook file.
